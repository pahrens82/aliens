                        constantly scan a 360-degree area
                        around the device with mapping
                        lasers. The Pups then send the
                        spectrograph information back to
                        a synced device, usually a starship
                        or ground-based HoloTab or a monitoring
                        station in a mobile command
                        vehicle. They can also detect lifeforms,
                        atmospheric conditions, toxins,
                        and more.
                        Pups were given their nickname
                        because they emit a haunting, houndlike
                        howling sound as they seek and
                        scan.</p>
