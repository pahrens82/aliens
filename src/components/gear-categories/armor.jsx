                        grasping.
                        A roll cage protects your face
                        while you operate one, and a webbed
                        harness keeps you strapped in in
                        case you take a tumble. The P-5000
                        is difficult to master, but a pro can
                        make operating it seem as simple as
                        walking. Many variants exist, including
                        a weaponized version and a wheeled
                        work loader for larger loads.</p>
