                    <p>These tripod-mounted robot sentries
                        form an automated perimeter
                        defense system that tracks and
                        automatically fires upon any target
                        that moves within range. The UA 571
                        series is equipped with automatic
                        thermal and movement actuated AI
                        targeting capabilities.
                        The UA 571-C utilizes an M30
                        Autocannon. Just be mindful of your
                        friend or foe settings before walking
                        in front of one. Those set up with ARS
                        &ndash; Advanced Recognition Software
                        &ndash; can be programmed to identify
                        friendly targets with a variable
                        success rate. If set for motion and
                        heat only, anything hot that moves
                        might as well be dead. Automation: When
                        activated, the Sentry Gun will fire at
                        the closest target according to its
                        settings with skill level 8 in Ranged Combat
                        (no Agility). The attack roll can't be
                        pushed. The Sentry Gun can also be
                        operated remotely by using a Head
                        Mounted Sight.</p>
