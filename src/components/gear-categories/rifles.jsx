                    <p>The standard issue weapon of the USCMC, the M41A Pulse
                        Rifle is a 10 mm automatic assault rifle with underslung
                        30 mm pump-action grenade launcher combined in a
                        sturdy housing with retractable stock and optional scope.
                        The M41A fires explosive-tip caseless standard light
                        armor-penetrating US M309 rounds accelerated via
                        electronic pulse. Remaining ammo is tracked via an LED
                        counter and the rifle has two firing modes &ndash; single-shot and
                        fully automatic. For more about the grenade launcher, see
                        the U1 on page 88.</p>

                        and colonists. It comes equipped with
                        “aiming assist,” where a targeting
                        sight sends data via external cable
                        to the dynamic rifle stock which then
                        makes minor changes to improve

                        prone to malfunction, and so the

                        redeveloped for the then upcoming

                <section class={"columns"}>
                    <p>This carbine-style flamethrower uses
                        naphtha fuel canisters to fire a thick,
                        steady stream of flame at a target.
                        It is in common use by the USCMC,
                        who deploy the weapon at the squad
                        and fireteam level. Civilian models
                        exist too. The troops in the field have
                        given the M240 the unceremonious
                        nickname of “Bake-a-Flake.” It's a
                        good standby weapon to have in a
                        pinch, especially when facing off
                        against hostile organisms. Most
                        animals retreat from fire, yes?
                        Fire effect: if hurt, the target
                        continues to burn with intensity 9
                        fire. Instead of hitting a specific
                        target, the incinerator may be used
                        to trigger intensity 9 fire in a
                        zone. A single 6 is needed in the
                        attack roll.</p>

                        manual docking maneuvers, the

                        harpoon that carries a tether.
                        The ASSO-400 is used to close

                        objects and personnel in space.
                        Harpoon Effect: On a hit, the grappling
                        hook attaches to the target. In zero-G,
                        if the target is heavier than you, you
                        can use the tether to rappel quickly
                        toward the target (full action, moves
                        you to adjacent range). If you are
                        heavier, you can instead pull the target
                        toward you (full action, moves the target
                        to adjacent range, requires a Strength
