                    <p>After several data losses from
                        electromagnetic pulses in the first
                        half of the 21st century, the move was
                        made to reintroduce and reinforce
                        physical data storage. Weyland
                        Corp scientists took optical disc
                        media and enhanced it to the next
                        level. The result is a nano-optical
                        long-data memory disc. All colony
                        and corporate records are backed
                        up on these discs in case of an
                        electromagnetic discharge.</p>

                <seciont class={"columns"}>
                    <p>A two-hundred-year-old technology,
                        magnetic tape cassettes have
                        become popular on the Frontier simply
                        because they are both disposable and
                        cheap. Utilizing sputter deposition
                        technology, these cassettes can hold
                        between 60, 90, or 120 terabytes (TB)
                        of information each.
                        While easily disrupted by a strong
                        magnetic pulse, the benefit of
                        magnetic tapes is that the archaic
                        technology that runs them produces
                        no easily detected wave signals.
                        Most security sensor grids are set to
                        detect more sophisticated electronic
                        hardware. All these factors combined
                        have managed to keep magnetic
                        tapes in vogue for the past fifty years.</p>
