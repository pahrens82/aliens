        <ul class={"simple-list"}>
            <li><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> If someone in the same zone as you is hit
                by an attack, you can spend a quick action to dive in to
                take the hit instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonus Shares:</strong> Gain +2 dice to MANIPULATION rolls
                when negotiating the payment for a job in campaign
                play (page 244).</li>
            <li><strong>Calm Breather:</strong> When making a supply roll for air, you
                get to roll two dice fewer than your air supply rating
                (page 28), to a minimum of one die.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Veteran:</strong> In combat, you may keep your
                initiative card from the previous round instead of
                drawing a new one.</li>
            <li><strong>Counselor:</strong> Once per stretch, you can use the MANIPULATION
                skill to reduce the stress level of another PC in
                the same zone. For each 6 rolled, their stress level is
                reduced by one extra step (in addition to the default one
                step, see page 73). You cannot use this talent on yourself,
                nor recover stress in the same stretch as you use it.</li>
            <li><strong>EVA Specialist:</strong> You get +2 to HEAVY MACHINERY and
                MOBILITY rolls when spacewalking.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Reflexes:</strong> When drawing initiative (page 59),
                draw two cards instead of one. Choose the one you want
                to use and shuffle the other back into the deck. If several
                characters have this talent, carry out this process one at
                a time in any order you prefer. PCs draw before NPCs.</li>
            <li><strong>Gunner:</strong> You get a +2 dice to RANGED COMBAT rolls
                when firing vehicle-mounted weapons or spaceship
                armaments.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardened:</strong> Your maximum Health score is increased
                by 1. You can choose this talent up to three times.</li>
            <li><strong>Haymaker:</strong> You get +2 dice to a CLOSE COMBAT attack
                if you sacrifice your quick action for the round.</li>
            <li><strong>Martial Arts:</strong> When you attack or defend unarmed in
                CLOSE COMBAT, you can use Agility instead of Strength.
                You can also make an unarmed attack as a quick action
                instead of a full action, but with -2 dice.</li>
            <li><strong>Last One Standing:</strong> You can rally yourself when
                broken (page 68) by rolling for STAMINA yourself.
                Only one attempt can be made.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechinegunner:</strong> When firing a burst of fully automatic
                fire (page 67), your stress level does not increase.</li>
            <li><strong>Menacing:</strong> When threatening someone to do what you
                want, roll Strength + MANIPULATION (instead of Empathy)
                and gain +2 dice.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigator:</strong> Roll for COMTECH when plotting a new
                course for space travel (page 108). For each 6 rolled,
                the duration of the trip is reduced by 10% (round off to
                the nearest whole number of days).</li>
            <li><strong>Pack Mule:</strong> You can carry twice as many items as
                normal without being encumbered.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Shot:</strong> If an enemy makes a ranged attack
                against you, you may as a quick action (reaction) try to
                shoot them first. Take +1 stress level, then roll for both
                attacks simultaneously. The shot with the most 6s goes
                off first. If both shots hit, the second shot is aborted if
                the shooter is broken. If both shots roll the same amount
                of 6s, both hit at the same time.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Fire:</strong> You can fire a pistol (chapter 5) as a quick
                action instead of a full action, but with -2 dice.</li>
            <li><strong>Second Wind:</strong> Anyone who tries to rally you (page
                68) gets +2 dice to their COMMAND roll.</li>
            <li><strong>Seen It All:</strong> Your Resolve score (page 26) is increased
                by 1. You can choose this talent up to three times.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor Operator:</strong> Gain +2 dice when rolling for
                COMTECH to operate ship sensors (page 143).</li>
            <li><strong>Spaceship Commander:</strong> In the role as a captain of a
                spaceship during space combat (page 143), you get
                +2 dice to COMMAND rolls for initiative and giving orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaceship Mechanic:</strong> Gain +2 dice when you use
                HEAVY MACHINERY or COMTECH to maintain or repair
                damage to a spacecraft (page 144).</li>
            <li><strong>Stealthy:</strong> Others get -2 dice to OBSERVATION rolls
                when trying to spot you in stealth mode (page 56).
                In groups, the talent has no effect unless everyone in
                the group has the talent.</li>
            <li><strong>Stoic:</strong> You can roll for STAMINA using Wits instead of
                Strength.</li>

            <li><strong>Tech Savvy:</strong> When making a supply roll for electric
                power, you get to roll two dice fewer than your power
                supply rating (page 29), to a minimum of one die.</li>
            <li><strong>Weapon Specialist:</strong> You're an expert at using a
                specific weapon model &ndash; choose one from the weapon
                lists in chapter 5. When you use this weapon, you get
                +2 dice. You can choose this talent several times, once
                per weapon model. You can be a specialist at fighting
                unarmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-G Training:</strong> Your sense of balance is well
                adapted to an environment without gravity. You don't
                suffer any of the penalties to skill rolls in zero-G
                (page 76).</li>
        </ul>
