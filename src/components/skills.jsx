            <p>There are twelve skills in total in the game. Three
                skills are typically linked to each of the four attributes:
                Strength, Agility, Wits, and Empathy. Skills are measured
                in skill levels, from 0 to 5. You can increase your skill levels
                during play (page 30).</p>
            <ol class={"simple-list"}>
                <li><strong>Heavy Machinery (Strength)</strong>: Hard work is part of life for any roughneck on the Frontier,
                    but at least you have powerful machines to help you. Roll
                    for this skill when you attempt to use, repair, jury-rig or
                    break any kind of heavy machinery.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stamina (Strength)</strong>: When your physical endurance or vigor is tested, roll for
                    STAMINA. For example, this skill is used to survive the cold
                    vacuum of space or to resist a deadly contagion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Close Combat (Strength)</strong>: The world of ALIEN is a brutal place. Sometimes, you have
                    no choice but to fight for your life, up close and personal.
                    Roll for this skill when you attack someone in CLOSE COMBAT.
                    Read more about close combat in chapter 4.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mobility (Agility)</strong>: Roll for MOBILITY to perform any kind of acrobatic
                    movement such as a risky climb or a dangerous jump.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Piloting (Agility)</strong>: Be it a dropship, a star freighter or a battle frigate, you’re
                    the one to fly it. Roll for PILOTING when you attempt any
                    difficult and dangerous maneuver at the helm of any type
                    of spacecraft (page 143). The skill can also be used to
                    drive ground vehicles.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ranged Combat (Agility)</strong>: If you have a ranged weapon, you can take down your
                    enemy from a distance without getting your hands
                    bloody. Use the RANGED COMBAT skill to fire all types
                    of ranged weapons. Read more about ranged combat
                    in chapter 4.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Comtech (Wits)</strong>: Programming androids, mainframes, and other types of
                    advanced technology requires specialist knowledge. Roll
                    for COMTECH for any challenging attempt to program, repair,
                    decrypt or otherwise manipulate any type of computer or
                    communications technology.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Observation (Wits)</strong>: In the world of ALIEN, you need to be on your guard at
                    all times, or you won't live long. Use your OBSERVATION
                    skill to spot someone sneaking. You can also use the
                    skill when you spot an unknown threat of some kind, to
                    learn more about it. Read more about stealth mode in
                    the next chapter.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Survival (Wits)</strong>: Terraforming can make the atmosphere on alien worlds
                    (passably) breathable, but it will rarely make them Earthlike.
                    You might be able to breathe without a pressure suit on
                    such worlds, though you can also expect to struggle
                    against extreme heat and cold, sandstorms, acid rain, and
                    other extreme weather. Roll for SURVIVAL when you're in
                    a hazardous environment to avoid becoming fatigued &ndash; or
                    worse (page 75).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Command (Empathy)</strong>: If you are to survive the horrors of space, you'll need a
                    good leader &ndash; or you must become one yourself. You can
                    use your COMMAND skill to stop panic in other PCs (page
                    72) and to give orders in combat (page 60).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Manipulation (Empathy)</strong>: Alien life forms may gut you without remorse, but the most
                    truly dangerous beings in the ALIEN universe are corporate
                    agents and other schemers who use lies, threats, or subtle
                    persuasion to get what they want. To make another person
                    see things your way, roll for MANIPULATION. If the person is
                    actively opposed to your point of view, this is an opposed
                    MANIPULATION roll (page 44). Your chances are affected
                    by your negotiating position (see the adjacent sidebar).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Medical Aid (Empathy)</strong>: In the world of ALIEN, there is a significant risk that you
                    or the other characters will be injured, sooner or later. Roll
                    for MEDICAL AID to give first aid to a dying character (page
                    68) or to make medical examinations.
