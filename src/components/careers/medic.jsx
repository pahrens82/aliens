                    exposure to vacuum or unknown contagions to vicious
                    organisms or getting accidentally shot by a drunken
                    roughneck. In all these scenarios, you're the one carrying
                    the bandages and adrenaline shots. When someone
                    suffers trauma, it's the first few minutes that matter most.
                    If someone survives long enough to make it to a MedPod,
                    you've done your job. You used to be altruistic about Frontier
                    medicine, but you've seen enough to become jaded. Too
                    many people in the Outer Veil are addicted to painkillers, and
                    most colonies are not up to health and safety regulations.
                    That means more people get hurt. Your work is never done.
