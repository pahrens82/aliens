                    assigned to the Frontier to find the next big thing. From
                    insider information to new mineral deposits &ndash; or even a
                    hitherto unknown life-form to exploit &ndash; it's up to you to
                    score a win for the company and use it to catapult yourself
                    up the corporate ladder. You tend not to form long-lasting
                    attachments, instead viewing everybody as a commodity
                    to capitalize on. Worry about others later. Right now, it's all
                    about the bottom line.

                            you had it all along! It can be any
                            item from chapter 5, or anything
                            else the GM deems reasonable,
                            but it cannot be larger than a
                            regular item (weight 1). The item
                            is not yours &ndash; the Company will
                            want it back.
