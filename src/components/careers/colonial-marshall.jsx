                <li>The Frontier can be a lawless place. The Colonial Marines
                    are spread thin &ndash; they have neither the time nor inclination to
                    mete out local justice. Not to worry &ndash; there's a new sheriff in
                    town, and that's you. Most law enforcement officers on the
                    Frontier are firmly planted deep in the back pocket of one
                    company or another &ndash; but not you. You don't take bribes and
                    you never look the other way. You've made a lot of enemies
                    on both sides of the law, but your colony has the lowest
                    crime rate in the system. It's only a matter of time before you
                    piss off the wrong CEO and corporate sends someone to
                    take care of you, but that's okay. You'll be ready.
