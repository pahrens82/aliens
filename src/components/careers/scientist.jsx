                <li>Every day, new pieces to the puzzle of existence are found
                    on the Frontier. Figuring out what makes them fit together
                    could leap humanity over nature's next hurdle, and you are
                    one thesis away from the respect you deserve. Some find
                    you cold and detached &ndash; they don't understand that your
                    passion is knowledge. Whether your field is xenobiology,
                    astrophysics, robotics, or even archaeology, there are
                    countless treasures in space, just waiting for someone to
                    trip over the next asteroid and run right into them. Whether
                    or not that's you, you're still the one who understands them
                    better than anyone.

                            OBSERVATION to gain insight
                            regarding strange and alien
                            artifacts or creatures that you
                            encounter. For every 6 you roll,
                            you get to ask the GM one of the
                            following questions: Is it human or
                            alien? Is it dead or alive? How old
                            is it? What is its purpose? How
                            does it work? What problems
                            could it cause? A successful roll
                            reduces the stress level of all
                            other PCs within Short range 1
                            step, while a failed roll increases
                            their stress levels by 1.

                            OBSERVATION roll (quick action).
                            If successful, you realize a potential
                            weakness of the creature, if
                            it has any. If you fail, gain stress
