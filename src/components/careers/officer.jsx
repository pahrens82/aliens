                <li>When everything is going to shit &ndash; the Company's holding
                    your crew's pay hostage, there's a mountain of reports to
                    file from that last incident near Thedus, and who knows
                    how many family members back home are weighing on
                    everyone's minds &ndash; it's a good thing you spent all those
                    years training to do this for a living. You're the authority
                    figure, the role model, the voice of your superiors, and the
                    enlisted crew's advocate. You're also the butt of all of their
                    jokes around the mess hall … until it all gets so much worse,
                    and they're looking to you for what to do next. Better hope
                    your training has a solution to this one.
