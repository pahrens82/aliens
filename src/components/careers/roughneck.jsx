                <li>Someone has to do the manual labor on the Frontier, and
                    that someone is you. Life has dealt you some harsh blows
                    but you've always struck back. You've been in countless
                    barroom brawls, you swear a lot, and belch at the dinner
                    table. In short, people find you uncouth. You really don't
                    care &ndash; you've grown past the need for niceties. No one
                    works harder than you. You are up before first dawn and
                    finish your workday long after second twilight. You are the
                    cog that keeps the wheels in the Frontier machine turning.
                    Your hands are calloused and your face is dirty, and the
                    only thing harder than the work you do is the way you party.

                            only) any time you suffer
                            damage. You can't push the
                            roll, which does not count as an
                            action. For every 6 you roll, one
                            point of damage is eliminated.

                            stress dice in any skill roll. When
                            rolling for stress or panic effects,
                            use your full stress level.

                            based on Strength twice. Stress
                            level +1 for each push.
