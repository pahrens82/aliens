                <li>Most of your friends will never see another world … but
                    not you. As soon as you were old enough, you signed up
                    for the USCMC. The pay is crap and the food is worse, but
                    you've always got a bunk to sleep in and you get to shoot
                    all sorts of weapons at all sorts of things. Life in the Corps
                    is never dull &ndash; but the luster has begun to fade. You've seen
                    things that you'll never be able to forget, and plenty you
                    wish you could.

                            72), you can ignore the result
                            and instead go into overkill. All
                            other PCs in the same zone must
                            make an immediate panic roll.
                            While in overkill, you must attack
                            your enemies on every turn and
                            you cannot take cover, dodge, or
                            defend yourself against attacks.
                            The effect stops when you or all
                            enemies in sight are broken.

                            fewer than your ammo supply
                            rating, to a minimum of one die.
